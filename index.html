            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Led by Hall of Famer Julius "Dr. J" Erving, the Nets won two ABA 
                championships in New York before becoming one of four ABA teams 
                to be admitted into the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. 
                Unlike the other three ABA teams entering the NBA, who played in 
                cities without any NBA presence, the Nets were required by the NBA 
                to pay an "encroachment fee" of $4.8 million to the New York Knicks.
                The team financed that payment by selling Erving's contract to the 
                Philadelphia 76ers; and the Nets went from winning the last ABA title 
                in 1975–76 to having the worst record in the NBA in 1976–77. The team 
                then moved back to New Jersey in 1977 and became the New Jersey Nets. 
                During their time in the state, the Nets played in two consecutive NBA 
                Finals in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons by teams led by point guard 
                Jason Kidd.</p>
